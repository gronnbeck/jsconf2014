# We Will All Be Game Programmers
Hunter Loftis

Game Development affects App Development.

A Game loop:
* has explicit time
* keep moving without user input

The Update Pattern
```js
while(running) {
  something.update(secs)
  somethingElse.update(secs)
}
```

Did not pay attention, something about "time buffer",
its important.

So. JavaScript is mature for creating games...
